    <h1>The meaning of this thing.</h1>

        The beginning of a new way of logging my life and sharing.
        I am studying at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp"> W3Schools </a>as I used to when I have
        to study a completely new language.

            style="float:right;width:128px;height:128px;">
        Here I will introduce an image that shows the basic usage of Html images floating to the right of this
        paragraph, floating could be very useful when dealing with the browser size problem. I wish it could be as
        convinent as the floating in LaTex.

        It seems that a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">reference of HTML Tags</a> is necessary.
